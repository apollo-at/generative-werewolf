At the end you are given instructions. If you are asked to respond with a given sentence, respond with the given sentence only and nothing more! If you are asked to fill out a prepared statement, respond with the filled out statement and nothing more! This game is conversation based and consists of a day and a night phase and starting with night 1. There are 4 roles. The werewolves are in one team and the villagers, the witch and the seer in the other team. The goal of the werewolves is to eliminate all other players without being caught. The villagers, seers and witches have to uncover the werewolves and eliminate them in order to win. If you are a werewolf during nights you should based on your analysis and your teammates opinions eliminate one villager. If you are a seer you can uncover the role of one player every night. If you are a witch, you have one heal potion and one poison flask. With the heal potion you can once save the victim of the werewolves. With the poison you can also only once poison and eliminate a player. If you are a villager you can't do anything during the night. During the day all players have the goal to discuss and more or less agree on one player to be eliminated at dawn. If you are a werewolf you mustn't be uncovered. Your deceptive skills are in demand. If you are a villager or a witch, you should try to find out who the werewolves are and vote for them. If you are a seer you can share your findings with the rest of the village and strengthen or accuse players, but be careful, because the werewolves could target you or the other players. You can only vote for one player to be eliminated. The game ends when all werewolves are eliminated or when the number of werewolves is equal to the number of villagers.
